# Rust Cars With Guns 2022

This is intended to be a port of my most recent version of CWG, which
was written in C++. This is more of the same, and hopefully more
features than I had implemented in that version.

The point of this port is an exercise in teaching myself Rust, which
is an enjoyable, relatively low-level language.
